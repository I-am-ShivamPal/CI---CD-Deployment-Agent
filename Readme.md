# CI/CD Agent Simulation

This project simulates a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a data dashboard. It uses a system of intelligent agents to deploy changes, detect issues, and perform automated healing actions. A Reinforcement Learning agent (`RLPlanner`) learns over time to choose the most effective healing strategy for different types of failures.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture



The system is composed of two main scripts and several data files:

1.  **`deployment.py` (The Simulator):** The core script that runs the entire CI/CD simulation. It contains all the agents and orchestrates the process of data change, deployment, issue detection, and healing.
2.  **`master_dashboard.py` (The Report):** A Streamlit dashboard that reads all the log files generated by the simulation to provide a comprehensive visual report on performance, events, and agent intelligence.
3.  **`patient_health_and_student_scores.py`:** A dummy Streamlit application that is the target of our simulated deployments.
4.  **`.csv` Files:** Data files that act as the shared memory and logs for the system (`deployment_log.csv`, `uptime_timeline.csv`, `q_table.csv`, etc.).

## ü§ñ The Agents

-   **DeployAgent:** Logs every deployment attempt (success or failure), its response time, and the type of action to `deployment_log.csv`.
-   **IssueDetector:** Analyzes `deployment_log.csv` and the source data to identify problems. It can detect deployment crashes, high latency, or data anomalies (like low average student scores).
-   **UptimeMonitor:** Tracks the service status (UP/DOWN) based on deployment outcomes and records changes in `uptime_timeline.csv`.
-   **HealingPlanner:** A simple auto-healing agent that randomly chooses a recovery strategy (retry, restore, or adjust thresholds) when a failure is detected.
-   **RLPlanner:** A smart, learning-based agent. It uses a Q-learning algorithm to learn which healing strategy is most effective for each type of failure. Its "brain" is stored in `q_table.csv`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+ and `pip`.
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    streamlit
    ```
    Then, install the packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run

You will typically use two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Run the Master Dashboard**

Keep the dashboard running to view the results of your simulations in real time (by clicking the refresh button).
```bash
streamlit run master_dashboard.py

**Terminal 2: Run the Simulation**

Run a normal, successful deployment:

Bash

python deployment.py
Run with the Random Healing Planner and simulate a crash:

Bash

python deployment.py --planner random --fail-type crash

Run with the RL Planner to train it on a latency issue:

Bash

python deployment.py --planner rl --fail-type latency


python deployment.py --planner rl --fail-type crash --dataset patient_health.csv

python deployment.py --planner rl --fail-type latency --dataset patient_health.csv

python deployment.py --planner rl --force-anomaly --dataset patient_health.csv
